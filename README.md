In the backend folder
add the dependencies of 
1.Express 
2.Mongodb
3.mongoose

And in the front end
the dependencies are
Axios


Thing to be done:
-Shift the databse to Postgre rather than Mongo for scalability 
We would need to apparently use both NoSQL and SQL for scaling in our project
Sooo lets discuss how to approach this porblem sometime soon

-Adding Video url into the databse by running the video through a cloud server, This would allow faster retieval of data and alsoo help in lesser load on Mongo
Cloudinary looks pretty promising 
and it offers 25gb for free users
Soo i think its really good - Task Completed


- Scaling of the Video while uploading the video: Since the video needs to be scaled properly before entering the cloud server, We somehow need to figure out how to scale the video to a proper ratio and then run it into the server

 -Registration and login page attached to the App and also Cleaning up of the UI of the app
{especially abt the video moving right and left with arrow keys} 
We should focus on a navbar??
Or we can ake use of the side blank space rather than hogging the top spacee
Let us discuss on the layout as well
